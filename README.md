# Supernovae.jl

This package provides functionality to generically load in supernova lightcurve data from delimited text. Mainly used as a backend for other supernova projects, such as my Shock Cooling Lightcurve fitter [ShockCooling.jl](https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/ShockCooling)

Examples and Documentation in progress.
